# Disrupt_Compose (py)
Python implementation of my Disrupt_Compose project while I _'get gud'_ with Rust first.

## Heads up

You will need to get a copy of any of the tools utilized by disruptcomposepy that I haven't developed myself.

## project_files.json

### Targets

Filetype to target

| Target | Description                             |
| ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| "auto" | Automatically determine target filetype |
| "fcb"  | Self-explanatory                        |
| "xml"  | Self-explanatory                        |

### Mutations

Note that a single file can have multiple mutations.

| Mutation | Significance                                                                                                |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "clear"  | Clear file contents before packing. Incredibly useful during research for identifying obsolete/unread files |


## Useless file warning

Enable/disable warning for known useless files:
